# bitAI ðŸ¤–

This project is a Streamlit application that is designed to implement and interact with various AI models.

## Models used

- `OpenAI ChatGPT-4`: This is an improved version of ChatGPT that can generate more human-like text. It's generally used for various tasks that involve natural language generation.
- `OpenAI ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo`: This model from OpenAI is designed to offer better performance than its predecessors at a lower cost. It's capable of generating contextually relevant, human-like text.
- `Meta AI Llama 2 - 70B Chat`: This model is a conversational AI developed by Meta. It can understand and generate human-like text, making it suitable for building interactive applications like chatbots.
- `Meta AI CodeLLaMA ðŸ¦™ 34B Instruct`: This is a Meta AI model trained on coding-related tasks. It understands programming instructions and can generate relevant code snippets.
- `Meta AI CodeLLaMA ðŸ¦™ 34B Fine Tuned for Python`: This model is similar to the 34B Instruct model but is specifically fine-tuned for generating Python code.
- `Meta AI CodeLLaMA ðŸ¦™ 13B Instruct`: This is another version of Meta's CodeLLaMA model with reduced parameter count. It can still understand programming instructions and generate relevant code.
- `Meta AI CodeLLaMA ðŸ¦™ 13B Fine Tuned for Python`: This version of the CodeLLaMA model is specifically fine-tuned to understand and generate Python code.
- `Meta AI CodeLLaMA ðŸ¦™ 7B Instruct`: This is a smaller version of the CodeLLaMA model designed by Meta. It's capable of understanding programming instructions and generating relevant code.
- `Meta AI CodeLLaMA ðŸ¦™ 7B Fine Tuned for Python`: Another version of Meta's CodeLLaMA model specifically fine-tuned to generate Python code.
